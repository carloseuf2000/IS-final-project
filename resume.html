I've gone from Fast Food restaurants like Subway to Big production line companies like Flex Electronics and Doterra, and fitness companies like Vasa. I love team work and have experience in management, training, and leadership in general. I like to learn what I'm supposed to do, and to learn ti do it fast. Once I do learn what I'm supposed to, I get things done the best and quickest way possible. I'm interested in going deeper in the fitness industry, but I'm open for any opportunity that comes and will excel in it! I'm working on a bachelors degree in Exercise Science with a minor in Business right now.</p>

                        <p class="lead">This is a summer job I was at. I started in the shipping position where I was to ship very delicate products such as the server racks which are well worth 1M$ each. It's a fast paced environment where you have to be both fast, and accurate. I am now over checking the quality of the racks before they are shipped. You are required to be very attentive to the smallest details in the CPUs and in the structure of the racks to make sure the clients get what they paid for. I work a lot with Excel, Teams, Zoom, and Gmail to document what's necessary and communicate with the rest of the company. I operate pallet jacks and many other tools. I also get to train the newcomers for about a week or 2 before they are released in the floor and I am reaponsible to get them comfortable in our fast paced environment.</p>
